We are a student body organization that aims to create a welcoming and inclusive community for all computer science students at the University of Cebu - Main Campus. Our goal is to promote inclusivity and diversity within the field of computing, ensuring that every student has the opportunity to explore their interests and succeed in their academic and professional pursuits.

Through a range of activities and events, we aim to create a space where students can connect with each other, share their ideas and experiences, and learn from each other. We are committed to promoting an environment where everyone feels valued and supported, regardless of their background, gender, ethnicity, or any other factor.

Join us at CSP-S and become part of a community that celebrates diversity and fosters growth and development for all students in the field of computer science. We welcome you with open arms!
